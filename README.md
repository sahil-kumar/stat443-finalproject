Final Project for STAT 443: Statistical Consulting at University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign

This is the code submitted to 84.51 as the basis for recommendations on how Kroger can better understand their customers and target specific demographics through their merchandise. 

The data was acquired from https://www.8451.com/area51/ and consists of transaction information from 5000 households across the United States. These households reported information such as household composition, income status, and housing situation. Information from transactions includes regions where purchases where made, unique basket ID's for each set of transactions made by an individual during a visit to the grocery store, and department information on the individual items.

The code is laid out in a few separate sections focusing on how data cleaning was performed, modeling techniques used, trend analysis, and an additional merchandise pairing analysis. Each of the analyses can be run sequentially from the beginning of the markdown file.
